## Lyrics

```
keep it airtight in the body bags
your feed for the mice of the mind
only thing that makes it right
wrap it up in conccussions
eating bite after bite 
memory so fragmented 
in chunks like it's vanished

keep it airtight in the body bags
your feed for the mice of the mind
only thing that makes it right
wrap it up in conccussions
eating bite after bite

bite after bite 

memory so fragmented 
it's vanished

keep it allright all together
holding on to your life
scream and shout into clouds
it's your fear for the life / it's the fear for your life

in eternal agony what you'll find
is the sense of the times



```
