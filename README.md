## Lyrics

```
keep it airtight in the body bags
your feed for the mice of the mind
only thing that makes it right
wrap it up in conccussions 
eating bite after bite 
memory so fragmented 
in chunks like it's vanished

keep it allright, all together
holding tight on to your vice
scream and shout into clouds
it's your fear for the life 
for the mind it's the doubts
that are paying the price
(compassion)
gaining vice after vice
till nothing's left in the 
us garish
through the agony of the 
what you'll find is the sense of the times

keep it airtight in the body bags
your feed for the mice of the mind
only thing that makes it right
wrap it up in conccussions
eating bite after bite

bite after bite 

memory so fragmented 
it's vanished

/ it's the fear for your life





```
